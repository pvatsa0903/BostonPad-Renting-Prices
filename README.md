# BostonPad-Renting-Prices
BostonPads is a real estate portal that caters to a large variety of property and real estate needs.
Due to the pandemic, they have seen many challenges in the real estate industry, including lack of
demand, falling prices and vacant properties. Boston is often considered the unofficial student
capital of the United States, so it is no stretch of the imagination that the university presence must
heavily impact the rental prices within the city. 

As 2021 has progressed, the country has reopened,
and so have the universities. This would be a good time for BostonPads to revisit their rental
pricing model based on geographic trends. We decided to analyze the effect of university proximity
on the pricing of a rental listing, to give them insight into how the market is shaping up.
By studying and understanding past research conducted on this topic (refer bibliography), though
not necessarily in the same city, we have developed the problem statement. It states that the prices
of rental apartments increase as the geographic proximity of that listing to a university increases.


We have sourced rental and university datasets from the City of Bostonâ€™s open data hub
(https://data.boston.gov/) as well as scraped rental listings from Craigslist -Boston
(https://boston.craigslist.org/) and BostonPads (https://bostonpads.com/). Through our data
sources, we were able to find information around apartment zip codes, number of bedrooms and
bathrooms, rental prices, size in square footage, amenities such as heat, electricity etc.

We have further extracted zip codes of several universities spread across Boston. Using this information,
we have been able to compare listing prices of apartments in university or non-university zip codes.

By simply exploring the data, we have found that currently, only 9.6% of the listings BostonPad
has posted are within university zip codes. Moreover, direct comparison of property
values has shown that properties in the university zip codes are valued at much higher than those
in non-university zip codes.

Considering the 3 major universities, i.e. Boston 3 university, Northeastern and University of Massachusetts, we further compared pricing based on
features such as bedroom and bathroom count.

Statistical analysis methodologies helped us gain insight into the significance of this data and the
relation between apartments listed in university and non-university zip codes. 

Craigslist listings showed no significant difference in unit prices based on zip code, but there was a significant
difference in rent per bedroom near university and non-university areas. However, BostonPad
listings showed significant difference based on the location of the listing, i.e. prices increase as
proximity to a university increases

Further improvements could be made to the BostonPads portal by adding features such as direct
price comparison with similar Craigslist listings, tie-up with management that has apartments in
university zip-codes with higher bedroom counts and feature more properties around the bigger
universities such as Northeastern and Boston University. BostonPads has the potential to become
the market leader in apartment rentals for students, provided it maintains a competitive pricing
model and continues to add relevant features to its website.
